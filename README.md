# Python Unit Testing Example

This repository contains a Python script `first_test.py` demonstrating how to write unit tests using the `unittest` module.

## Description

The `first_test.py` script contains a collection of unit tests for various string manipulation functions. It covers basic string methods like `upper()`, `split()`, `strip()`, etc., as well as more complex tests such as checking for palindromes, anagrams, finding the longest common prefix, reversing words in a string, and generating a Fibonacci sequence.

## Usage

To run the unit tests, simply execute the `first_test.py` script using Python:

```bash
python first_test.py

Dependencies
This script requires Python 3.x to be installed on your system.
